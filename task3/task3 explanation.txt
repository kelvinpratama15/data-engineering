1. data from multiple source (Mongo DB, RDBMS, Text file or JSON) are imported to staging database with ETL process
2. create star scheme. consist fact and dimension table for every analytical point of view 
(using slowly changing dimension for updating content of dimension table and use timestamp in fact table so we can 
aggregate, group, and filter by time range)
3. for every single star scheme, create the data visualization trough tools like Tableau, ClickView, or PowerBI.
